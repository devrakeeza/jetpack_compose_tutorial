# Jetpack Compose Tutorial

This repository contains the source code for a tutorial series on building Android applications using Jetpack Compose, a declarative UI toolkit for building native Android apps.


## Introduction ðŸ‘‹

Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit for building Android user interfaces. It allows you to write your UI code in a declarative manner, similar to how you would write a website using React or Vue. Compose is designed to be easy to learn, flexible, and efficient, with built-in support for animations, gestures, and other common UI features.

This tutorial series will guide you through building a simple Android application using Jetpack Compose. You will learn the basics of Compose, including how to create layouts, handle user input, and navigate between screens. By the end of the tutorial, you will have a functional app that you can run on your Android device or emulator.
